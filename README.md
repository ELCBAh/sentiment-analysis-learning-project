# This is an AI sentiment analysis project

## Project Description

The basic idea is to create a sentiment analysis model that can analyze the sentiment of a given text.

I will be using python libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn (scikit-learn), nltk and transformers, and I will create the interface with flutter.
